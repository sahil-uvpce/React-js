# React-js
React-js Development
## Installation
install nodejs and npm first.
To install React with npm, run:
CODE: npm init
      npm install --save react react-dom
     
Using a CDN
If you don't want to use npm to manage client packages, the react and react-dom npm packages also provide single-file distributions in dist folders, which are hosted on a CDN:
CODE: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.js"></script>
      
The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:
CODE: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
